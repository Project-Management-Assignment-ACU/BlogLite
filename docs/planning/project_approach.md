# Project Approach

## Project Lifecycle Methodology

Our project will follow a **Hybrid Agile-Waterfall** approach, combining the best aspects of both methodologies:

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Approach | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Planning | Waterfall | Clear upfront planning for project scope and milestones |
| Development | Agile | Iterative development with regular feedback |
| Documentation | Waterfall | Comprehensive documentation for maintainability |
| Testing | Agile | Continuous testing and integration |

### Project Phases

1. **Planning Phase** (Week 1)
   - Requirements gathering
   - Architecture design
   - Resource planning
   - Risk assessment

2. **Development Phase** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Two-week sprints
   - Daily standups
   - Weekly demos
   - Continuous integration

3. **Testing Phase** (Week 4)
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance testing

4. **Deployment Phase** (Week 5)
   - Production deployment
   - User training
   - Documentation finalization
   - Project handover
